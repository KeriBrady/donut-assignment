# donut-assignment

In donut-assignment.html, the script will automatically calculate how many donuts are needed for 5 Top Pot stores by hour as well as the total number of donuts needed per day.

After finding randomly generated number of people who walk by, the script will find how many customers come in by taking the percentage of normal walk-in customers (from the range of traffic), then multiply the result by average donuts purchased per person.

Once those values are calculated, the hourly projected donut sales will print to the console for each hour the stores are open, then will add the hourly donuts sold and print a total number of donuts needed per day. This will be completed for each of the five Top Pot shops.

##Sources and Collaborators:

The function to return a random number from an array was found and edited from a script here: source: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1527803/generating-random-numbers-in-javascript-in-a-specific-range.

I worked on this project with Mark Ryman, and together we were able to solve a lot of the issues that were getting us stuck. In particular, he helped me with parts of the code involving arrays (in particular, storing hourly donut sales in an array as well as strings of text stating store hours).
